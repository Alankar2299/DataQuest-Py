# Instacart-Online-Grocery-Store-Customer-Profiling


**Data Analysis for Online Grocery Store Instacart**

**Project Brief:**
The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database
along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same
methods, and theyâ€™re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different
customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale
of their products. Your analysis will inform what this strategy might look like to ensure Instacart
targets the right customer profiles with the appropriate products.
